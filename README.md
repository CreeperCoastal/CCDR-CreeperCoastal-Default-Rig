# CCDR-CreeperCoastal-Default-Rig
A 3D Minecraft Player model, fully rigged for Prisma3D!

If you'd like to use CCDRv3.x you can go to the prebious releases!

CCDRv4 contains a new base model fully compatible with Prisma3D!

My rig is meant to be a compatible yet highly customizable rig, I don't care if it doesn't look clean.

If this rig is locked by a password, the password will be in the video and not as a secret note written here nor inside!


CCDRv4 Release!

A new base model, with almost everything seen in CCDRv3.x ported over for better compatibility with the app!
However it is quite a heavy boi... but it may be worth sacrificing a few frames right?
